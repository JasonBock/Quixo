1.0 Changes

The UI model has to change from using internal methods to events - i.e. when a piece is clicked make it raise the Selected event ONLY IF the board has designated it to be IsSelectable.

Create a new algorithm that measures groups in a row. See my notes in my notebook for a description of the ranking algorithm and how this will work. Once this is done, run a series of tests, pitting it against the current "smart" algorithm.

Need to slow down the computer move generation and/or animate it somehow so the user can see what it looks like.

The computer moves must be made using BackgroundWorker and it must be cancellable. 

All configuration changes should go to IsolatedStorage.

Make a "genius" computer engine via genetic algorithms.
